# Chalked Up color theme

This is a VSCode color theme, with colors very roughly based on the Xcode
theme Sidewalk Chalk.

As an experiment, I'm following the general recommendations of Nikita
Prokopov (@tonsky) in his blog post, "[I am sorry, but everyone is getting
syntax highlighting wrong](https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/)."
The general idea is that most syntax highlighting is wildly excessive and
hinders code understanding rather than helping it. Most keywords are left
unhighlighted, as are variable and function *references*; variable and
function *declarations* are deemed meaningful and are still highlighted.
